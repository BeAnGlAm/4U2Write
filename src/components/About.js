      <p>Welcome to Write On.</p>
      <p>
        This is your space. Come as often as you’d like to get into the practice
        of writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to write about anything at all; it might be a place to journal
        or it might be a place to get into some creative writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re feeling blocked about a writing topic, join writers from all
        over the world and use our communal daily writing prompt to help you get
        started. Please feel free to support other writers in the WriteOn
        community by submitting your own writing prompts at the bottom of the
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
        To strengthen your writing practice you can set a goal for how long you
        aim to write for. To help keep you on track to meet your goal, you will
        be gently notified if you’ve been away from your keyboard for 15
        seconds.

        “An artist must have enough solitude and enough connection. It takes
        practice, and the conscious building of daily ritual.” - Julia Cameron,
        The Artist’s Way.
